# Search-Rotated
Solution for "Leetcode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array"

# Description

This Python algorithm solves the problem of searching for a target value in a rotated sorted array. Given an integer array nums that is sorted in ascending order but may be rotated at an unknown pivot index, the algorithm aims to find the index of the target value in nums. 

The algorithm utilizes a modified version of binary search to achieve an optimal time complexity of O(log n).
